People with Trisomy 21 (Down's Syndrome) have trouble remembering information. Music therapy can aid in memorization of important information.

1. random spacing generated between words to create a cadence
2. words spoken aloud to a cadence
3. repeat ad infinitum so processing moves from aural loop to musical memory
